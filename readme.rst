Botan: Crypto and TLS for C++11
========================================

Botan (Japanese for peony) is a cryptography library written in C++11
and released under the permissive `Simplified BSD
<http://botan.randombit.net/license.txt>`_ license.

It contains TLS client and server implementation, X.509 certificates,
ECDSA, AES, GCM, ChaCha20Poly1305, McEliece, bcrypt and other useful
tools.

As part of the build there is also a `botan` program built for command
line usage (similar to `openssl`). The sources for these are intended to
act as good examples of library usage.

Development is coordinated on `GitHub <https://github.com/randombit/botan>`_
and contributions are welcome. Read `doc/contributing.rst` for more
about how to contribute.

For all the details on building the library, read the
`users manual <http://botan.randombit.net/manual>`_, but basically::

  $ ./configure.py --help
  $ ./configure.py [probably some options]
  $ make
  $ ./botan-test
  # lots of output...
  Tests all ok
  $ ./botan
  # shows available commands
  $ make install

The library can also be built into a single-file amalgamation for easy
inclusion into external build systems.

If you need help or have questions, send a mail to the
`mailing list <http://lists.randombit.net/mailman/listinfo/botan-devel/>`_
or open a ticket on
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/randombit/botan/issues>`_. If you
think you've found a security bug, read the
`security page <http://botan.randombit.net/security.html>`_
for contact information and procedures.

In addition to C++, botan has a C89 API specifically designed to be easy
to call from other languages. A Python binding using ctypes is included,
there are also partial bindings for
`Node.js <https://github.com/justinfreitag/node-botan>`_ and
`OCaml <https://github.com/randombit/botan-ocaml>`_ among others.

There is no support for the SSH protocol in Botan but there is a
seperately developed C++11 SSH library by `cdesjardins
<https://github.com/cdesjardins/cppssh>`_ which uses Botan for crypto
operations.

Some distributions such as Arch, Fedora and Debian include packages
for Botan. However these are often out of date; using the latest
source release is recommended.

Current Development Work (1.11)
----------------------------------------

The 1.11 branch is highly recommended, especially for new projects.
Versions 1.11 and later require a working C++11 compiler; GCC 4.8 and
later, Clang 3.4 and later, and MSVC 2013 are regularly tested.

The latest development release is
`1.11.29 <http://botan.randombit.net/releases/Botan-1.11.29.tgz>`_
`(sig) <http://botan.randombit.net/releases/Botan-1.11.29.tgz.asc>`_
released on 2016-03-20

Old Stable Series (1.10)
----------------------------------------

The 1.10 branch is the last version of the library written in C++98
and is the most commonly packaged version. It is still supported for
security patches, but all development efforts are focused on 1.11.

The latest 1.10 release is
`1.10.13 <http://botan.randombit.net/releases/Botan-1.10.13.tgz>`_
`(sig) <http://botan.randombit.net/releases/Botan-1.10.13.tgz.asc>`_

Books and other resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should have some knowledge of cryptography *before* trying to use
the library. This is an area where it is very easy to make mistakes,
and where things are often subtle and/or counterintuitive. Obviously
the library tries to provide things at a high level precisely to
minimize the number of ways things can go wrong, but naive use will
almost certainly not result in a secure system.

Especially recommended are:

- *Cryptography Engineering*
  by Niels Ferguson, Bruce Schneier, and Tadayoshi Kohno

- *Security Engineering -- A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems*
  by Ross Anderson
  (`available online <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html>`_)

- *Handbook of Applied Cryptography*
  by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. Van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone
  (`available online <http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/>`_)

If you're doing something non-trivial or unique, you might want to at
the very least ask for review/input on a mailing list such as the
`metzdowd <http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography>`_ or
`randombit <http://lists.randombit.net/mailman/listinfo/cryptography>`_
crypto lists. And (if possible) pay a professional cryptographer or
security company to review your design and code.
