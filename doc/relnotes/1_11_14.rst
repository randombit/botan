Version 1.11.14, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* OCB mode, which provides a fast and constant time AEAD mode without
  requiring hardware support, is now supported in TLS, following
  draft-zauner-tls-aes-ocb-01. Because this specification is not yet
  finalized is not yet enabled by the default policy, and the
  ciphersuite numbers used are in the experimental range and may
  conflict with other uses.

* The memory allocator available on Unix systems which uses mmap and
  mlock to lock a pool of memory now checks an environment variable
  BOTAN_MLOCK_POOL_SIZE. If this is set to a smaller value then the
  library would originally have allocated the user specified size is
  used. You can also set it to zero to disable the pool entirely.
  Previously the allocator would consume all available mlocked memory,
  this allows botan to coexist with an application which wants to
  mlock memory of its own.

* The library can now only be initialized once. If the library is
  already initialized and a LibraryInitializer is created, it has no
  effect. If the first library initializer leaves scope then a new
  initializer can be created.

  LibraryInitializer can now only be used in an RAII fashion; the
  static `initialize` and `deinitialize` functions have been removed.
