Version 1.11.14, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The global state object previously used by the library has been
  removed and no form of initialization is required to use the library.
  LibraryInitializer remains as a stub.

* The new `ffi` submodule provides a simple C API/ABI for a number of
  useful operations (hashing, ciphers, public key operations, etc)
  which is easily accessed using the FFI modules included in many
  languages. A new Python wrapper using the Python `ctypes` module
  is available. The old Boost.Python wrapper has been removed.

* OCB mode, which provides a fast and constant time AEAD mode without
  requiring hardware support, is now supported in TLS, following
  draft-zauner-tls-aes-ocb-01. Because this specification is not yet
  finalized is not yet enabled by the default policy, and the
  ciphersuite numbers used are in the experimental range and may
  conflict with other uses.

* The memory usage of the counter mode implementation has been reduced.

* The memory allocator available on Unix systems which uses mmap and
  mlock to lock a pool of memory now checks an environment variable
  BOTAN_MLOCK_POOL_SIZE. If this is set to a smaller value then the
  library would originally have allocated the user specified size is
  used. You can also set it to zero to disable the pool entirely.
  Previously the allocator would consume all available mlocked memory,
  this allows botan to coexist with an application which wants to
  mlock memory of its own.

* The botan-config script previously installed on Unix systems has
  been removed. Its functionality is replaced by the `config` command
  of the `botan` tool executable, for example `botan config cflags`
  instead of `botan-config --cflags`.
