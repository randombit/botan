/**
 * @brief Alignment buffer helper
 *
 * Many algorithms have an intrinsic block size in which they consume input
 * data. When streaming arbitrary data chunks to such algorithms we must store
 * some data intermittently to honor the algorithm's alignment requirements.
 *
 * This helper encapsulates such an alignment buffer. The API of this class is
 * designed to minimize user errors in the algorithm implementations. Therefore,
 * it is strongly opinionated on its use case. Don't try to use it for anything
 * but the described circumstance.
 *
 * @tparam T                     the element type of the internal buffer
 * @tparam BLOCK_SIZE            the buffer size to use for the alignment buffer
 * @tparam FINAL_BLOCK_STRATEGY  defines whether the final input data block is
 *                               retained in handle_unaligned_data() and must be
 *                               manually consumed
