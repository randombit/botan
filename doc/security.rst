2016
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* 2016-03-17 (CVE-2016-2849): ECDSA side channel

  ECDSA (and DSA) signature algorithms perform a modular inverse on the
  signature nonce `k`.  The modular inverse algorithm used had input dependent
  loops, and it is possible a side channel attack could recover sufficient
  information about the nonce to eventually recover the ECDSA secret key. Found
  by Sean Devlin.

  Introduced in 1.7.15, fixed in 1.10.13 and 1.11.29

* 2016-03-17 (CVE-2016-2850): Failure to enforce TLS policy

  TLS v1.2 allows negotiating which signature algorithms and hash functions each
  side is willing to accept. However received signatures were not actually
  checked against the specified policy.  This had the effect of allowing a
  server to use an MD5 or SHA-1 signature, even though the default policy
  prohibits it. The same issue affected client cert authentication.

  The TLS client also failed to verify that the ECC curve the server chose to
  use was one which was acceptable by the client policy.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.29

* 2016-02-01 (CVE-2016-2196): Overwrite in P-521 reduction

  The P-521 reduction function would overwrite zero to one word
  following the allocated block. This could potentially result
  in remote code execution or a crash. Found with AFL

  Introduced in 1.11.10, fixed in 1.11.27

* 2016-02-01 (CVE-2016-2195): Heap overflow on invalid ECC point

  The PointGFp constructor did not check that the affine coordinate
  arguments were less than the prime, but then in curve multiplication
  assumed that both arguments if multiplied would fit into an integer
  twice the size of the prime.

  The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the
  output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm in
  cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled
  multiplication function.

  The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding,
  which accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for
  remote code execution.

  On systems which use the mlock pool allocator, it would allow an
  attacker to overwrite memory held in secure_vector objects. After
  this point the write will hit the guard page at the end of the
  mmap'ed region so it probably could not be used for code execution
  directly, but would allow overwriting adjacent key material.

  Found by Alex Gaynor fuzzing with AFL

  Introduced in 1.9.18, fixed in 1.11.27 and 1.10.11

* 2016-02-01 (CVE-2016-2194): Infinite loop in modular square root algorithm

  The ressol function implements the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for
  finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due
  to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite
  modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.
  This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the OS2ECP
  function during ECC point decompression. Found by AFL

  Introduced in 1.7.15, fixed in 1.11.27 and 1.10.11

* 2015-11-04: TLS certificate authentication bypass

  When the bugs affecting X.509 path validation were fixed in 1.11.22, a check
  in Credentials_Manager::verify_certificate_chain was accidentally removed
  which caused path validation failures not to be signaled to the TLS layer.  So
  for affected versions, certificate authentication in TLS is bypassed. As a
  workaround, applications can override the call and implement the correct
  check. Reported by Florent Le Coz in GH #324

  Introduced in 1.11.22, fixed in 1.11.24

* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7824): Padding oracle attack on TLS

  A padding oracle attack was possible against TLS CBC ciphersuites because if a
  certain length check on the packet fields failed, a different alert type than
  one used for message authentication failure would be returned to the sender.
  This check triggering would leak information about the value of the padding
  bytes and could be used to perform iterative decryption.

  As with most such oracle attacks, the danger depends on the underlying
  protocol - HTTP servers are particularly vulnerable. The current analysis
  suggests that to exploit it an attacker would first have to guess several
  bytes of plaintext, but again this is quite possible in many situations
  including HTTP.

  Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.22

* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7825): Infinite loop during certificate path validation

  When evaluating a certificate path, if a loop in the certificate chain
  was encountered (for instance where C1 certifies C2, which certifies C1)
  an infinite loop would occur eventually resulting in memory exhaustion.
  Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Introduced in 1.11.6, fixed in 1.11.22

* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7826): Acceptance of invalid certificate names

  RFC 6125 specifies how to match a X.509v3 certificate against a DNS name
  for application usage.

  Otherwise valid certificates using wildcards would be accepted as matching
  certain hostnames that should they should not according to RFC 6125. For
  example a certificate issued for '*.example.com' should match
  'foo.example.com' but not 'example.com' or 'bar.foo.example.com'. Previously
  Botan would accept such a certificate as valid for 'bar.foo.example.com'.

  RFC 6125 also requires that when matching a X.509 certificate against a DNS
  name, the CN entry is only compared if no subjectAlternativeName entry is
  available. Previously X509_Certificate::matches_dns_name would always check
  both names.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.22

* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7827): PKCS #1 v1.5 decoding was not constant time

  During RSA decryption, how long decoding of PKCS #1 v1.5 padding took was
  input dependent. If these differences could be measured by an attacker, it
  could be used to mount a Bleichenbacher million-message attack. PKCS #1 v1.5
  decoding has been rewritten to use a sequence of operations which do not
  contain any input-dependent indexes or jumps. Notations for checking constant
  time blocks with ctgrind (https://github.com/agl/ctgrind) were added to PKCS
  #1 decoding among other areas. Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Fixed in 1.11.22 and 1.10.13. Affected all previous versions.

* 2015-08-03 (CVE-2015-5726): Crash in BER decoder

  The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an empty vector if
  it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain any data at all. This can be
  used to easily crash applications reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not
  seem exploitable for code execution. Found with afl.

  Fixed in 1.11.19 and 1.10.10, affected all previous versions of 1.10 and 1.11

* 2015-08-03 (CVE-2015-5727): Excess memory allocation in BER decoder

  The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory in a length
  field, even if there was no chance the read request would succeed.  This might
  cause the process to run out of memory or invoke the OOM killer. Found with afl.

  Fixed in 1.11.19 and 1.10.10, affected all previous versions of 1.10 and 1.11

* 2014-04-10 (CVE-2014-9742): Insufficient randomness in Miller-Rabin primality check

  A bug in the Miller-Rabin primality test resulted in only a single random base
  being used instead of a sequence of such bases. This increased the probability
  that a non-prime would be accepted by is_prime or that a randomly generated
  prime might actually be composite.  The probability of a random 1024 bit
  number being incorrectly classed as prime with a single base is around 2^-40.
  Reported by Jeff Marrison.

  Introduced in 1.8.3, fixed in 1.10.8 and 1.11.9
