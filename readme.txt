Botan 1.8.9, 2010-06-16

Botan is a C++ class library for performing a wide variety of
cryptographic operations.

I consider this release the best version available, and recommend all
users upgrade from 1.6 or earlier versions of 1.8 as soon as
possible. Some APIs have changed incompatibly since the 1.6 release
series, but most applications should work as-is or with only simple
modifications.

Botan is released under the FreeBSD license (see doc/license.txt for
the specifics). More information about the authors and contributors
can be found in doc/credits.txt and doc/thanks.txt.

You can file bugs at http://bugs.randombit.net/ or by sending a report
to the botan-devel mailing list:
  http://lists.randombit.net/mailman/listinfo/botan-devel/

In the doc directory, there should be a set of PDFs, including

building.pdf - build instructions
api.pdf - the API reference manual
tutorial.pdf - a set of simple examples and tutorials

A number of example programs can be found in doc/examples.

Check http://botan.randombit.net/ for announcements and new
releases. If you'll be developing code using this library, consider
joining the mailing lists to keep up to date with changes and new
releases.

As always, feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
