1.11.14, Not Yet Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* OCB mode, which provides a fast and constant time AEAD mode without
  requiring hardware support, is now supported in TLS, following
  draft-zauner-tls-aes-ocb-00. Because this specification is not yet
  finalized is not yet enabled by the default policy, and the
  ciphersuite numbers used are in the experimental range and may
  conflict with other uses.
