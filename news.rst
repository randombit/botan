Version 3.8.1, 2025-05-07
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix a bug that prevented building using the ``fips140`` or ``modern`` module
  policies. (GH #4854 #4856)

* Fix a missing include that caused compilation failures with libc++20
  (GH #4855 #4857)

Version 3.8.0, 2025-05-06
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Discussion has started regarding plans for Botan4, current ETA 2027. Check the
  tracking ticket in https://github.com/randombit/botan/issues/4666 for the
  current plans.

* Ongoing elliptic curve optimizations and cleanups (GH #4554 #4620 #4623 #4625
  #4627 #4632 #4634 #4686 #4687 #4688 #4689 #4690 #4692 #4695 #4703 #4706 #4708
  #4710 #4711 #4746 #4794)

* Add support for extended private keys in ML-KEM to handle certain implementations
  which do not use the seed encoding. (GH #4817)

* Add support for SHA-512 instructions added in upcoming Intel processors (GH #4766)

* Add support for SM4 instructions added in upcoming Intel processors (GH #4768)

* The SHA-1 implementation using SSE2 has been extended to support NEON and LoongArch LSX.
  (GH #4809)

* Add SHA-256 and SHA-512 implementations using AVX2/BMI2 (GH #4818 #4821)

* Add SHA-512 implementation using AVX-512/BMI2 (GH #4842 #4849)

* Add SHA-256 implementation using SSSE3 or NEON for message expansion (GH #4819)

* The default TLS policy now prefers AES/GCM over ChaCha20Poly1305 (GH #4843)

* Add support for TLS 1.3 post-quantum KEM secp384r1/ML-KEM-1024 (GH #4752)

* Fix bugs in the server-side implementation of TLS 1.3 post-quantum hybrid
  encryption which affected ciphersuites using NIST curves. (GH #4752)

* Previously ``build.h`` included various parameters which could be modified by
  end users prior to compilation. These have been removed. (GH #4639)

* Previously ``build.h`` had macros reflecting various information about the
  target system, such as ``BOTAN_TARGET_OS_IS_LINUX``. Now all such macros have
  been moved to a new internal header. This allows sharing all installed
  headers, including ``build.h``, across multiple different builds of the
  library, as long as they all have the same version and module selection. This
  simplifies vendoring the library. (GH #4642 #4747)

* Various headers have been modified to minimize the number of inclusions they
  make. You may need to modify your application to directly include any headers
  which up until now had been implicitly pulled in. (GH #4650)

* Add an FFI example which also works as a test in CI that prevents accidentally
  making changes to ``ffi.h`` or ``build.h`` that make them incompatible with C. (GH #4640)

* Add new FFI functions regarding stateful private keys (GH #4700), OIDS (GH #4816),
  and EC_Group (GH #4834)

* Add missing checks for null pointer arguments in FFI (#4704)

* Faster base32 encoding using SWAR technique (GH #4765)

* Add support for X.509 CRLs with the ``nextUpdate`` field unset. Such CRLs
  are prohibited by RFC 5280, but do unfortunately exist within the ecosystem. (GH #4732)

* When encoding a RSASSA-PSS-Params struct, skip encoding the trailer field
  default value, as required by RFC 4055 (GH #4731)

* Extend vector permute AES to support big-endian AltiVec/VMX systems. (GH #4738)

* Extend use of POWER VMULL instruction to also support big-endian systems. (GH #4743)

* Fix encoding extended key usage in PKCS10 requests (GH #4725)

* Add internal API for hybrid PQ combiner keys (GH #4067)

* Internal refactorings of CPU feature detection. (GH #4718)

* Add support for CPU feature detection on RISCV64 (GH #4800 #4815)

* Add support for the LoongArch LSX SIMD extension in AES, SHA-1, ZFEC, ChaCha (GH #4799)

* Various SIMD-enabled implementations which previously only required SSE2 now additionally
  require SSSE3. Such optimizations will no longer be used on (now quite rare) CPUs which
  support SSE2 but not SSSE3. (GH #4803)

* Optimize parsing of large CRLs (GH #4789 #4790 #4792)

* Improve performance of RSA public and private key parsing (GH #4793)

* Add a couple examples of using format preserving encryption (GH #4758)

* CI cleanups and improvements (GH #4756 #4761 #4762 #4767 #4770 #4812 #4813)

* The ``Ed25519_PrivateKey`` constructor had behavior that varied based on the
  input length. Add explicit ``from_seed`` and ``from_bytes`` functions which
  make the two options explicit. (GH #4701 #4702)

* Add a new cleaner interface for handling ECIES flags (GH #4691)

* Reduce use of heap in GCM/GMAC (GH #4826) and hex/base64 (GH #4832)

* New faster Barrett reduction implementation (GH #4835)

* Internal RSA signature padding cleanups (GH #4635)

* Cleanups to the implementations of SHA-1 and SHA-256 using SHA-NI (GH #4773 #4774)

* Cleanups to reduce code size where possible (GH #4775 #4777 #4781 #4825)

* Fix a bug that caused the tests to skip testing AES-NI if AES-VAES was supported.
  (GH #4649)

* Fix issues with CMake integration when built in Debian-style multiarch setups.
  (GH #4839)

* Now even for purely static library builds, ``-fPIC`` is used to compile the
  library objects. This allows linking position independent executables (PIE)
  against the static library. (GH #4716)

* Remove support for NetBSD ``_dlauxinfo`` which did not provide the information
  that the library had expected it to. (GH #4736)

* Add a script for comparing the performance between versions (GH #4693 #4754)

* Update GHA CodeQL actions (GH #4644)

Version 3.7.1, 2025-02-05
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Revert a change that prevented ``build.h`` from being usable from
  C applications. (GH #4636 #4637)

Version 3.7.0, 2025-02-04
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add post-quantum scheme Classic McEliece (GH #3883 #4448 #4458 #4508 #4605)

* In TLS enable the hybrid x25519/ML-KEM-768 post quantum secure key
  exchange by default for clients and servers. (GH #4305)

* Support for the pre-standard Kyber-r3 key exchange has been removed from TLS
  (GH #4507 #4403)

* In TLS add support for "pure" ML-KEM key exchange, in addition
  to the existing hybrid ML-KEM + EC suites. (GH #4393)

* Add new EC key constructors (GH #4437 #4563)

* Internal EC optimizations and improvements (GH #4385 #4432 #4436
  #4492 #4479 #4510 #4511 #4512 #4517 #4518 #4532 #4533 #4549 #4550
  #4552 #4556 #4557 #4564 #4566 #4570 #4601 #4604 #4608 #4619 #4624 #4626)

* An important note relating to EC groups, especially for users who do not build
  the library using the default module settings (ie using ``--minimized-build``
  or ``--disable-deprecated-features``). Until 3.7.0, including support for an
  elliptic curve algorithm such as ECDSA also implicitly pulled in support for
  all elliptic curves. This is no longer the case. You can re-enable support for
  specific named curves by adding a ``pcurves`` module, for example
  ``pcurves_secp256r1`` or ``pcurves_brainpool384r1``. Also in 3.7.0, the old
  BigInt based EC arithmetic implementation was moved to ``legacy_ec_point``,
  which is marked as deprecated. Disabling this module will disable support for
  certain (also deprecated) elliptic curves such as "x962_p239v1" and
  "secp224k1". It will also disable support for application specific
  curves. Depending on your usage you may need to enable the ``legacy_ec_point``
  module. (GH #4027)

* Change OID formatting and PK signature padding naming to avoid
  obsolete IEEE 1363 naming (GH #4600)

* Improve performance of RSA private key parsing (GH #4588)

* Fix a regression introduced in 3.6.0 which would cause many P-521
  secret keys to be rejected as invalid due to not having the expected
  length. (GH #4541 #4539)

* Add new operations to EC_AffinePoint (GH #4433 #4503 #4618)

* Add support for PSS-signed certificates using SHA-3 (GH #4610)

* Expose ``PSS_Params`` type (GH #3867 #4606)

* Optimize modular inversions (GH #4569)

* KDF internals modernization (GH #4455)

* Split compiler.h into api.h and compiler.h (GH #4599)

* Deprecate creating uninitialized DL_Group or EC_Group (GH #4598)

* Extend SP800-108 KDFs to support variable length fields (GH #4551)

* TPM 2.0 improvements (GH #4429 #4430 #4482)

* Add support for invoking Entropy Source and DRNG Manager (ESDM) RNG (GH #4309)

* Improve support for baremetal environments (GH #4519 #4521 #4531)

* Fix a bug preventing parsing of OCSP responses containing more than
  one pinned certificate (GH #4536)

* Expand constant-time testing in CI to cover both GCC and Clang,
  and multiple optimization levels. (GH #4421)

* Allow configuring at build time how constant-time value barriers
  are implemented. (GH #4447)

* GCM/GHASH internal cleanups (GH #4469)

* Documentation updates (GH #4586)

* Internal cleanups related to calling ``getauxval`` (GH #4471)

* Add a ``--timer-unit=`` option to ``botan speed`` (GH #4456 #4490)

* Rename the ``nist`` policy to ``fips140`` to more accurately reflect
  usage. Update with regards to latest NIST standards. (GH #4614)

* Update the Limbo test suite (GH #4406)

* Mark several classes not intended for derivation as ``final`` (GH #4419)

* Add iterator debugging to CI (GH #4413)

* Starting in 3.6.0, ``configure.py`` would pass through any values set as
  ``CXXFLAGS`` into the link invocation as well. This was done to support
  LTO style options. However it causes build regressions, especially with MSVC,
  and so has been reverted. Using the new option ``--lto-cxxflags-to-ldflags``
  will cause this passthrough behavior to continue. (GH #4196 #4200 #4451 #4452)

* Fix an iterator error in the test suite (GH #4413)

* Fix build issues caused by incompatible changes in Boost 1.87 (GH #4484)

* Fix a build issue when AVX2 support is disabled (GH #4493)

* Fix a build issue when compiling with MSVC on ARM (GH #4483)

* Address some new warnings from Clang 19 (GH #4544 #4545 #4548)

Version 3.6.1, 2024-10-26
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  experimental Kyber r3 TLS ciphersuites, leaving only the standardized
  ML-KEM suites. (GH #4407 #4403)

* Fix a bug in x86 CPUID detection introduced in 3.6.0 which would cause
  crashes on systems which have BMI1 but not BMI2. (GH #4402 #4401)

* Fix a bug in SLH-DSA signing, which did not default to the FIPS
  required randomized variant. (GH #4398)

* Modify how elliptic curve blinding is performed, reducing the number
  of self-additions that may occur during multiplication. (GH #4408)

* In ``speed`` command line utility, also iterate keygen several times.
  (GH #4381)

Version 3.6.0, 2024-10-21
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fully integrate and further optimize the new ECC library first introduced in
  3.5.0. For common curves, operations are 2 to 3 times faster. This also
  introduces a new API for low level EC operations, such a point multiplication,
  using ``EC_Scalar`` and ``EC_AffinePoint`` types.

* Optimize XTS mode (GH #4047)

* Optimize name constraint processing (GH #4047)

* Optimize FrodoKEM-AES (GH #4176 #4174 #4173)

* The build system now distinguishes between LLVM Clang and XCode's Clang
  fork. For the latter, use compiler target "xcode". (GH #4010)

* Fix a bug in ``scrypt`` autotune where, if it was called with a
  nominal maximum memory limit of zero (meant to indicate no limit)
  would only ever return parameters using 1 MB.

* Constant time programming improvements including ``CT::value_barrier``
  and ``CT::Choice`` (GH #4154 #4115 #4096 #4108)

* Refactor and optimize AlternativeName. This includes a new API.

* Generate Kuznyechik tables at compile time instead of hard coding them.
  (GH #4017)

* Enable using ``sysctlbyname`` on iOS (GH #4018)

* Previously Curve25519 was used to refer to key exchange over the Montgomery
  curve modulo 2**255-19. This is now called X25519 in all cases. Typedefs and a
  deprecated header are retained for compatibility with older versions. (GH
  #4012)

* Fix several bugs related to encoding and decoding ASN.1 object identifiers
  when the second arc is larger than 40. (GH #4063 #4023)

  extension) from RFC 8226. (GH #4116)

* Add One-Step KDF from SP 800-56C (GH #4121)

* Fix a bug in RFC 6979 mode ECDSA. This only caused problems when
  testing with certain curves and does not have any security or interop
  implications. (GH #4040)

* Previously elliptic curve private keys could be of any size, with the
  effective key reduced modulo the group order. Now during decoding the
  private key must be in the specified bound. (GH #4040)

* Elliptic curve groups now verify that the prime and group order are
  related in the manner expected. (GH #4039 #4041)

* Add a script to run the Limbo X.509 path validation test suite.

* Update the BoGo TLS test suite (GH #4078)

* Deprecate various low level BigInt and elliptic curve interfaces (GH #4038 #4056)

* In 3.3.0, support for application specific curves in EC_Group with
  parameters larger than 521 bits was deprecated. This release expands
  that deprecation to further restrict future use of application
  specific curves (see deprecated.rst for details). Add a new EC_Group
  constructor which enforces these restrictions. (GH #4038)

* Fix a bug when creating a PKCS10 request or X.509 self signed certificate
  when SubjectAlternativeName was included in the provided extensions. If
  this occurred, any other values (eg opts.dns) would be ignored. (GH #4032)

* Various low level multi precision integer refactorings and improvements.
  (GH #4156 #4149 #4007 #4008 #3989 #3987)

* Increase the maximum supported key length of KMAC to 192 bytes (GH #4109)

* Improve the utilities for checked (overflow safe) addition and multiplication.
  (GH #3999)

* Optimize parsing of IPv4 dotted quad strings (GH #4058)

* A system for marking modules as deprecated was introduced in 3.4.0, but it did
  not mark any modules as deprecated. This has now been applied to various
  modules, which will then be disabled if ``--disable-deprecated-features``
  option is used at build time. (GH #4050)

* Fix a bug in ``configure.py`` that caused ``--with-stack-protector`` to not
  work. (GH #3996)

* Upgrade CI to use XCode 15.2 on x86-64 and XCode 15.3 on aarch64. (GH #4005)

  curve library. (GH #3973 #3977 #3962 #3957 #3964 #3956 #3961 #3950)

* Use a new method for constant time division in Kyber to avoid a possible
  side channel where the compiler inserts use of a variable time division.

Version 3.2.0, 2023-10-09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add support for (experimental!) post-quantum secure key exchange
  in TLS 1.3 (GH #3609 #3732 #3733 #3739)

* Add support for TLS PSK (GH #3618)

* Add a first class interface for XOFs (GH #3671 #3672 #3701)

* Add KMAC from NIST SP 800-185 (GH #3689)

* Add cSHAKE XOF; currently this is not exposed to library users but
  is only for deriving further cSHAKE derived functions. (GH #3671)

* Add improved APIs for key encapsulation (GH #3611 #3652 #3653)

* As Kyber's 90s mode is not included in the NIST draft specification,
  and most implementations only support the SHAKE based mechanism,
  the Kyber 90s mode is now deprecated. (GH #3695)

* Previously ``KyberMode`` enums had elements like ``Kyber512`` to identify the
  scheme. These have changed to have ``_R3`` suffixes (like ``Kyber512_R3``) to
  clearly indicate these are not the final version but is instead the version
  from round3 of the PQC competition. The old names continue on as (deprecated)
  aliases. (GH #3695)

* Fix bugs in various signature algorithms where if a signature
  operation was used after the key object had been deleted, a use
  after free would occur. (GH #3702)

* The types defined in pubkey.h can now be moved (GH #3655)

* Add the Russian block cipher Kuznyechik (GH #3680 #3724)

* The ``TLS::Group_Params`` enum is now a class which emulates the
  behavior of the enumeration. (GH #3729)

* Implement serialization for the Certificate Authority TLS extension
  (GH #3687)

* Refactored the internal buffering logic of most hash functions
  (GH #3705 #3693 #3736)

* Add OS support for naming threads; now Botan thread pool threads
  are identified by name. (GH #3628 #3738)

* Updated the TLS documentation to reflect TLS 1.3 support and
  the removal of TLS 1.0 and 1.1. (GH #3708)

* Upon deserialization, the ``EC_Group`` type now tracks the encoding
  which was used to create it. This is necessary to implement policies
  which prohibit use of explicit curve encodings (which are in any case
  deprecated). (GH #3665)

* If compiling against an old glibc which does not support the ``getrandom``
  call, now the raw syscall is used instead. (GH #3688 #3685)

* On MinGW the global thread pool is disabled by default (GH #3726 #2582)

* Various internal functions now use ``std::span`` instead of raw pointers
  plus length field. NOTE: any implementations of ``BlockCipher``, ``HashFunction``
  etc that live outside the library will have to be updated. This is not covered
  by the SemVer guarantee; see ``doc/sem_ver.rst`` (GH #3684 #3681 #3713 #3714
  #3698 #3696)

* Add helper for buffer alignment, and adopt it within the hash function
  implementations. (GH #3693)

* Added support for encoding CRL Distribution Points extension in new
  certificates (GH #3712)

* Internal refactoring of SHA-3 to support further SHA-3 derived functionality
  (GH #3673)

  where the TLS implementation sent the incorrect alert type in various
  error cases which were discovered using TLS-Anvil (GH #3676)

* Add initial (currently somewhat experimental) support for using the ninja
  build system as an alternative to make. (GH #3677)

* Remove an unused variable in BLAKE2b (GH #3624)

* Fix a number of clang-tidy warnings in the headers (GH #3646)

* Add checks for invalid length AD in Argon2 (GH #3626)

* CI now uses Android NDK 26, and earlier NDKs are not supported
  due to limitations of the C++ library in earlier NDKs (GH #3718)

* Improve support for IBM's XLC compiler (GH #3730)

* Avoid compilation failures when using ``-Werror`` mode with GCC 12
  due to spurious warnings in that version. (GH #3711 #3709)

Version 3.1.1, 2023-07-13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix two tests which were insufficiently serialized. This would
  cause sporadic test failures, particularly on machines with
  many cores. (GH #3625 #3623)

Version 3.1.0, 2023-07-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add SPHINCS+ post quantum hash based signature scheme (GH #3564 #3549)

* Several small TLS compliance fixes, primarily around rejecting
  invalid behavior from the peer (GH #3520 #3537)

* Adapt TLS 1.3 to use a KEM interface to prepare for PQ key exchange
  (GH #3608)

* Fix custom key exchange logic integration for TLS 1.2 server (GH #3539)

* Add initial wrappers for using AVX-512, and implement AVX-512 versions
  of ChaCha and Serpent. (GH #3206 #3536)

* Add support for an environmental variable which can disable CPU extensions
  (GH #3535)

* Update the BSI policy to match the latest TR (GH #3482)

* Update the BoringSSL test suite shim (GH #3616)

* Add FFI functions relating to Kyber key management (GH #3546)

* The entire codebase has been reformatted using ``clang-format``.
  (GH #3502 #3558 #3559)

* Fix many warnings generated from ``clang-tidy``.

* ``BigInt::random_integer`` could take a long time if requested to
  generate a number within a small range between two large integers.
  (GH #3594)

* Fix bugs related to ``--library-suffix`` option. (GH #3511)

* Improve cli handling of PBKDF configuration (GH #3518)

* Fix the cli to properly update stateful keys (namely XMSS) when using such
  a key to sign a X.509 certificate (GH #3579)

* Add support for using PSK in the TLS CLI utilities (GH #3552)

* Add an example of hybrid RSA+symmetric encryption (GH #3551)

* In the Python module, the pbkdf function defaulted to 10K iterations.
  This has been changed to 100K.

* Switch to using coveralls.io for coverage report (GH #3512)

* Add a script to analyze the output of ``botan timing_test``

* Due to problems that arise if the build directory and source
  directory are on different filesystems, now hardlinks are only
  used during the build if explicitly requested. (GH #3504)

* The ``ffi.h`` header no longer depends on the ``compiler.h`` header.
  (GH #3531)

* Avoid using varargs macros for ``BOTAN_UNUSED`` (GH #3530)

* Small base64 encoding optimization (GH #3528)

* If the build system detects that the compiler in use is not supported,
  it will error immediately rather than allow a failing build. Currently
  this is only supported for GCC, Clang, and MSVC. (GH #3526)

* The examples are now a first class build target; include
  ``examples`` in the set provided to ``--build-targets=`` option in
  order to enable them. (GH #3527)

* Remove the (undocumented, unsupported) support for CMake (GH #3501)

Version 3.0.0, 2023-04-11
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Botan is now a C++20 codebase; compiler requirements have been
  increased to GCC 11, Clang 14, or MSVC 2022. (GH #2455 #3086)

Breaking Changes
----------------------------------------

* Remove many deprecated headers. In particular all algorithm specific
  headers (such as ``aes.h``) are no longer available; instead objects
  must be created through the base class ``create`` functions. (GH #2456)

* Removed most functions previously marked as deprecated.

* Remove several deprecated algorithms including CAST-256, MISTY1, Kasumi,
  DESX, XTEA, PBKDF1, MCEIES, CBC-MAC, Tiger, NEWHOPE, and CECPQ1 (GH #2434 #3094)

* Remove the entropy source which walked ``/proc`` as it is no longer
  required on modern systems. (GH #2692)

* Remove the entropy source which reads from ``/dev/random`` as it is
  supplanted by the extant source one which reads from the system RNG.
  (GH #2636)

* Remove use of ``shared_ptr`` from certificate store API, as since
  2.4.0 ``X509_Certificate`` is internally a ``shared_ptr``. (GH #2484)

* Several enums including ``DL_Group::Format``, ``EC_Group_Formatting``,
  ``CRL_Code``, ``ASN1_Tag``, ``Key_Constraints`` and ``Signature_Format`` are
  now ``enum class``.  The ``ASN1_Tag`` enum has been split into ``ASN1_Type``
  and ``ASN1_Class``.  (GH #2551 #2552 #3084 #2584 #3225)

* Avoid using or returning raw pointers whenever possible. (GH #2683 #2684
  #2685 #2687 #2688 #2690 #2691 #2693 #2694 #2695 #2696 #2697 #2700 #2703 #2708
  #3220)

* Remove support for HP and Pathscale compilers, Google NaCL (GH #2455),
  and IncludeOS (GH #3406)

* Remove deprecated ``Data_Store`` class (GH #2461)

* Remove deprecated public member variables of ``OID``, ``Attribute``,
  ``BER_Object``, and ``AlgorithmIdentifier``. (GH #2462)

* "SHA-160" and "SHA1" are no longer recognized as names for "SHA-1"
  (GH #3186)

TLS Changes
----------------------------------------

* Added support for TLS v1.3

* Support for TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and DTLS 1.0 have been removed (GH #2631)

* Remove several deprecated features in TLS including DSA ciphersuites (GH #2505),
  anonymous ciphersuites (GH #2497), SHA-1 signatures in TLS 1.2 (GH #2537),
  SRP ciphersuites (GH #2506), SEED ciphersuites (GH #2509),
  Camellia CBC ciphersuites (GH #2509), AES-128 OCB ciphersuites (GH #2511),
  DHE_PSK suites (GH #2512), CECPQ1 ciphersuites (GH #3094)

New Cryptographic Algorithms
----------------------------------------

* Add support for Kyber post-quantum KEM (GH #2872 #2500)

* Add support for Dilithium lattice based signatures (GH #2973 #3212)

* Add support for hashing onto an elliptic curve using the SSWU
  technique of draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve (GH #2726)

* Add support for keyed BLAKE2b (GH #2524)

New APIs
----------------------------------------

* Add new interface ``T::new_object`` which supplants ``T::clone``. The
  difference is that ``new_object`` returns a ``unique_ptr<T>`` instead of a raw
  pointer ``T*``. ``T::clone`` is retained but simply releases the result of
  ``new_object``. (GH #2689 #2704)

* Add an API to ``PasswordHash`` accepting an AD and/or secret key, allowing
  those facilities to be used without using an algorithm specific API (GH #2707)

* Add new ``X509_DN::DER_encode`` function. (GH #2472)

* New API ``Public_Key::get_int_field`` for getting the integer fields of a public
  (or private) key by name (GH #3200)

* New ``Cipher_Mode`` APIs ``ideal_granularity`` and ``requires_entire_message``
  (GH #3172 #3168)

* New ``Private_Key::public_key`` returns a new object containing the public
  key associated with that private key. (GH #2520)

* ``SymmetricAlgorithm::has_keying_material`` allows checking if a key has
  already been set on an object (GH #3295)

* Many new functions in the C89 interface; see the API reference for more details.

Implementation Improvements
----------------------------------------

* Add AVX2 implementation of Argon2 (GH #3205)

* Use smaller tables in the implementations of Camellia, ARIA, SEED, DES,
  and Whirlpool (GH #2534 #2558)

* Modify DES/3DES to use a new implementation which avoids most
  cache-based side channels. (GH #2565 #2678)

* Optimizations for SHACAL2, especially improving ARMv8 and POWER (GH #2556 #2557)

* Add a fast path for inversion modulo ``2*o`` with ``o`` odd, and modify RSA
  key generation so that ``phi(n)`` is always of this form. (GH #2634)

* Use constant-time code instead of table lookups when computing parity bits
  (GH #2560), choosing ASN.1 string type (GH #2559) and when converting to/from
  the bcrypt variant of base64 (GH #2561)

* Change how DL exponents are sized; now exponents are slightly larger and
  are always chosen to be 8-bit aligned. (GH #2545)

Other Improvements
----------------------------------------

* Changes to ``TLS::Stream`` to make it compatible with generic completion tokens.
  (GH #2667 #2648)

* When creating an ``EC_Group`` from parameters, cause the OID to be set if it
  is a known group. (GH #2654 #2649)

* Fix bugs in GMAC and SipHash where they would require a fresh key be
  provided for each message. (GH #2908)
