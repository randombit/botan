Botan is a C++ class library for performing a wide variety of
cryptographic operations, including encryption, hashing,
authentication, public key encryption and signatures, and creating and
using X.509v3 certificates and CRLs. PKCS #8 private keys (including
PKCS #5 encryption) and PKCS #10 certificate requests are also
included. As well as various modes, padding schemes, and so forth,
Botan supports the following basic cryptographic algorithms:

* Public Key Algorithms: Diffie-Hellman, DSA, ElGamal, Nyberg-Rueppel,
    Rabin-Williams, RSA

* Block Ciphers: AES, Blowfish, CAST-128, CAST-256, DES, DESX,
    TripleDES, GOST, IDEA, KASUMI, Noekeon, Lion, Luby-Rackoff, MARS,
    MISTY1, RC2, RC5, RC6, SAFER-SK, SEED, Serpent, Skipjack, Square,
    TEA, Twofish, XTEA

* Stream Ciphers: ARC4, WiderWake4+1, Salsa20, Turing

* Hash Functions: HAS-160, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160,
    SHA-160, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Tiger, Whirlpool

* MACs: ANSI X9.19 MAC, CMAC, HMAC
