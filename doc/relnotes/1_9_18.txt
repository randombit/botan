Version 1.9.18, 2011-06-03
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fourth release candidate for 1.10.0

* The GOST 34.10 verification operation was not ensuring that s and r
  were both greater than zero. This could potentially have meant it
  would have accepted an invalid all-zero signature as valid for any
  message. Due to how ECC points are internally represented it instead
  resulted in an exception being thrown.

* A simple multiexponentation algorithm is now used in ECDSA and
  GOST-34.10 signature verification, leading to 20 to 25% improvements
  in ECDSA and 25% to 40% improvements in GOST-34.10 verification
  performance.

* The internal representation of elliptic curve points has been
  modified to use Montgomery representation exclusively, resulting in
  reduced memory usage and a 10 to 20% performance improvement for
  ECDSA and ECDH.

* In OAEP decoding, scan for the delimiter bytes using a loop that is
  written without conditionals so as to help avoid timing analysis.
  Unfortunately GCC at least is 'smart' enough to compile it to
  jumps anyway.

* The SSE2 implementation of IDEA did not work correctly when compiled
  by Clang, because the trick it used to emulate a 16 bit unsigned
  compare in SSE (which doesn't contain one natively) relied on signed
  overflow working in the 'usual' way. A different method that doesn't
  rely on signed overflow is now used.

* Add support for compiling SSL using Visual C++ 2010's TR1
  implementation.

* Fix a bug under Visual C++ 2010 which would cause ``hex_encode`` to
  crash if given a zero-sized input to encode.

* A new build option ``--via-amalgamation`` will first generate the
  single-file amalgamation, then build the library from that single
  file. This option requires a lot of memory and does not parallelize,
  but the resulting library is smaller and may be faster.

* On Unix, the library and header paths have been changed to allow
  parallel installation of different versions of the library. Headers
  are installed into ``<prefix>/include/botan-1.9/botan``, libraries
  are named ``libbotan-1.9``, and ``botan-config`` is now namespaced
  (so in this release ``botan-config-1.9``). All of these embedded
  versions will be 1.10 in the upcoming stable release.

* The soname system has been modified. In this release the library
  soname is ``libbotan-1.9.so.0``, with the full library being named
  ``libbotan-1.9.so.0.18``. The ``0`` is the ABI version, and will be
  incremented whenever a breaking ABI change is made.

* TR1 support is not longer automatically assumed under older versions
  of GCC

* Functions for base64 decoding that work standalone (without needing
  to use a pipe) have been added to ``base64.h``

* The function ``BigInt::to_u32bit`` was inadvertently removed in 1.9.11
  and has been added back.

* The function ``BigInt::get_substring`` did not work correctly with a
  *length* argument of 32.

* The implementation of ``FD_ZERO`` on Solaris uses ``memset`` and
  assumes the caller included ``string.h`` on its behalf. Do so to
  fix compilation in the ``dev_random`` and ``unix_procs`` entropy
  sources. Patch from Jeremy C. Reed.

* Add two different configuration targets for Atom, since some are
  32-bit and some are 64-bit. The 'atom' target now refers to the
  64-bit implementations, use 'atom32' to target the 32-bit
  processors.

* The (incomplete) support for CMS and card verifiable certificates
  are disabled by default; add ``--enable-modules=cms`` or
  ``--enable-modules=cvc`` during configuration to turn them back on.
